# RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis with DESeq2

This repository contains the implementation of an RNA-Seq differential expression analysis pipeline using the **DESeq2** package from Bioconductor. The project focuses on identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gaining insights into biological processes, leveraging techniques like **Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST)** for normalization and robust statistical modeling.

---

## **Overview**
RNA-Seq is a powerful tool for transcriptomic analysis, enabling the discovery of genes that are differentially expressed under various experimental conditions. This project highlights:
- Preprocessing RNA-Seq count data.
- Normalization using **Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST)**.
- Differential expression analysis with the **DESeq2** negative binomial model.
- Visualization of results through PCA plots, MA plots, and heatmaps.

---

## **Features**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Importing raw count matrices.
   - Normalizing data using **VST** for variance stabilization.
   
2. **Statistical Modeling**:
   - Differential expression analysis using DESeq2.
   - Estimating log-fold changes and adjusted p-values.

3. **Visualization**:
   - **PCA plots**: For sample clustering.
   - **MA plots**: Visualizing log-fold changes against mean expression.
   - **Heatmaps**: Highlighting expression patterns of significant genes.

4. **Biological Insights**:
   - Enrichment analysis for pathways and functional annotations.
   - Identifying potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

   BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
   ```

3. Run the analysis script in R or RStudio:
   ```R
   source("analysis_script.R")
   ```

4. Input your count matrix and metadata into the script as specified.
